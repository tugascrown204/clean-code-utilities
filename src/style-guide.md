# Clean Code Style Guide

## General Principles
- **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand.
- **Simplicity**: Keep design simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Consistency**: Follow conventions and standards applied in the project.

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions in Python.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions in JavaScript.

## Best Practices
- Write functions that do one thing and do it well.
- Limit the number of parameters for functions.
- Write tests for your code and keep them updated.
